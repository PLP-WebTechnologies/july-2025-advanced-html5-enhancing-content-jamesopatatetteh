# Enhanced HTML5 Form Assignment

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of advanced HTML5 content elements and a complete, validated HTML5 form. It showcases lists, tables, and media to organize and enrich content, followed by a user-friendly form that leverages built-in HTML5 validation without relying on JavaScript.

## Objectives
The assignment covers:
- Organizing content with **lists** and **tables**.
- Embedding **media elements** (images, audio, video).
- Creating structured **HTML5 forms** that are accessible and intuitive.
- Applying form attributes like `required`, `placeholder`, `autocomplete`, `readonly`, and `pattern`.
- Using HTML5 **validation features** to reduce incorrect input.

## Features
1. **Lists**: Demonstrates unordered and ordered lists.
2. **Table**: A sample schedule table with headers and rows.
3. **Media**: Includes an image, audio, and video example.
4. **Form**:
   - Personal information fields (name, email, age, password, phone).
   - Input validation using attributes (`required`, `minlength`, `pattern`, `min`, `max`).
   - Selection fields (`select`, radio buttons, color input).
   - Text area for comments.
   - Submit and reset functionality.

## Example Structure
- `header`: Title and introduction.
- `main`: Sections for lists, table, media, and form.
- `footer`: Copyright.

## Requirements
- A modern web browser that supports HTML5.
- No external libraries required.

## How to Run
1. Save the file as `enhanced-form.html`.
2. Open it in any web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
3. Interact with the form to test HTML5 validation features.
